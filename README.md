# pi-calculation
This projects calculates the first $n$ digits of $\pi$.

Two carts are positioned on a frictionless trail with a wall at the end; the first one 
has mass $m$ and the second one mass $m \cdot 10^{2(n-1)}$.

The first cart remains between the wall and the second cart, it is pushed towards it and then starts
to oscillate between the two constraints with perfectly elastic collisions until the second cart stops.

The number of times the first cart collides with the wall or with the other cart is equal to the digits of $\pi$.
